		<center><h2>Jesus Raises Lazarus</h2></center>
	<center><h2>(John 11:1-44)</h2></center>
			<p>A friend of Jesus named Lazarus was very sick. He has 2 sisters named Mary and Martha sent a message to Jesus about Lazarus, when Jesus got the message he stayed where he was for the next 2 days for the glory of God. After the two days, Jesus finally said, let’s go back to Judea (where Mary and Martha live).  The disciples said that the people will stone him again. Jesus says our friend Lazarus is asleep, and I will go and wake him up. Jesus knows they think he is asleep, not dead so he told them Lazarus is dead. When they arrived, Lazarus was already in his grave for 4 days. Martha went to meet Jesus. Jesus and Martha are talking about Lazarus rising again. After their discussion, Martha gone to get Mary and Mary gone to see Jesus. Then Mary weeps at Jesus' feet, and Jesus weeps with her. Then Mary and Martha take Jesus to where Lazarus is buried. A huge crowd was watching Jesus ask for the stone to be moved. Then Jesus prays to God then tells Lazarus to come out of where he was buried, Lazarus was raised up from the dead, the people take the funeral clothes off of Lazarus as they were amazed.
