			<h1>About this website</h1>
			<p> This website is just a little intro to help you start your journey with Jesus. This is my assessment website for credits, but I hope you can learn more about Jesus. There is info on churches you can go to learn more about God and have a strong faith in him.

			<h1>About Christian’s</h1>
			<img class="textwrap2"src="images/christians.webp"alt="Images"/> <!--class="img2"-->
			<h2>What are Christian's?</h2>
						<p>Christians are people who believe in God who created the earth and is the father, Jesus the son of God who died for our sins and rose, and the Holy Spirit is who came to the world after Jesus rose. Being a Christian is not just life insurance from hell, but it is having a relationship with God and doing what God designed for us to do.</p>
						
			<img class="textwrap1" src="images/cross website.webp"alt="Images"/> <!--class="img3"-->
			<h3> Who are God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit?</h3>
						<p> God created the earth and the heavens, Jesus is the son who came to Earth to teach us to love each other and healed the blind, lame, sick, raised people from the dead and more amazing things he did. Then he died on a cross for our sins, then he rose from the grave so one day we can go to heaven. The Holy Spirit is who Jesus sent to guide us to do the right thing and amazing things that Jesus did, and the Holy Spirit can do more things.</p>

						<h4>What is Prayer?</h4>
						<p>Prayer is a way you can talk to God and how he can talk to you. Remember, it's a two-way conversation. There is no wrong way of praying to God, as everyone is different. It is good to thank God for what he has done in your life, and what is on your mind. Don’t worry if you don’t get a response from him immediately, as he hears you all the time, so just be patient with his response.
