				<center><h2>Ruth</h2></center>
				<center><h2>(Ruth 1 :1-5)</h2></center>
			<p>Naomi leaves her home from a famine and settled in Moab With her 2 sons and husband. Her 2 sons married and one of them Married Ruth. Then Naomi's husband died then later on her sons died
 </p>
				<center><h2>(Ruth 1:6-22)</h2></center>
			<p>As the Lord blessed Naomi's home again, Naomi went home with her two new daughter in laws, then Naomi told them during their stay there to go home, but both daughter in laws don’t want to leave Naomi. Naomi tried to send them off again and finally 1 of the daughter in laws went home, but Ruth stayed, so Naomi gave in and let her come with her. When they both got to Naomi’s home, Naomi told her neighbours to call her Mara.</p>
			
				<center><h2>(Ruth 2)</h2></center>
			<p>Ruth goes out to collect wheat that has been left behind at Boaz’s field, for her and Naomi. Boaz is a relative of Naomi's husband; he told his workers to treat Ruth nicely and tells Naomi to only harvest wheat at his field. Ruth had thanked Boaz for his kindness. Next Boaz called Ruth to have food, and tells his worker to purposely drop the wheat heads for Ruth, when Ruth finished, she went home to show Naomi. Ruth worked at the field the whole harvest.</p>
			
				<center><h2>(Ruth 3)</h2></center>
			<p>Naomi told Ruth instructions, Ruth followed what Naomi says Boaz woke up and told Ruth that there is someone closer than him. If that man wants to marry Ruth then he can, but if not then Boaz will marry Ruth. Ruth stayed the night then left with wheat in her cloak from Boaz and told Naomi everything.
</p>
			
				<center><h2>(Ruth 4)</h2></center>
			<p>It is about Boaz going to town and settling with the other relative to marry Ruth, but the relative doesn't want to marry Ruth, so Boaz did, and they had a child with their great-great-grandson named David who fought Goliath and became king of Israel.</p>
