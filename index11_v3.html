	<center><h2>(John 6:1-14 & Mark 6:30-44)</h2></center>
			<p>When the disciples finished the missions, they went back to Jesus and told them what they did. Since there are a lot of people, Jesus took his disciples across the sea, but there are people who went ahead of them, so Jesus teaches them about God. Then in the afternoon the people were hungry. Jesus asked for food, but they had no food for the 5,000 people, the disciples said to him to send them away to go and get food. Jesus disagrees and asks if anyone has food. A disciple found a boy with 2 fish and 5 loaves. Jesus asks everyone to sit down. Jesus blesses the food and hands it out to everyone.at the end they had 12 baskets of food left.
