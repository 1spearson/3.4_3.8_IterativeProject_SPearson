			<center><h2>Daniel in the Lions Den</h2></center>
			<center><h2>(Daniel 6)</h2></center>
			<p> Daniel is chosen to supervise the high officers with over administrators then one day the king was planning to put Daniel on over the entire empire. The administrators then were not happy and were trying to find a fault in Daniel's way but they could not find one. Then one day the administrators then went to the king to make a law to force people to pray only to the king for 30 days and whoever does not will not and pray to their God will be thrown into the lion's den. The king agreed and signed to agree. Once it's signed there is no undoing a law. Daniel learned about it and went home to pray to God. he prayed 3 times like usual then the officers went to Daniel's home and found out he was praying to God and told the king. The king was finding a way to save Daniel. That evening they went to the king and reminded him of the laws. Then the king finally told them to throw Daniel into the lion's den. Daniel got thrown into the lion's den and it got sealed by a stone. That night the king could not sleep. The next morning the king went to see if Daniel was alright, the stone was moved and Daniel was alive. God sent his angels to close the lion's mouth. The king ordered his men to take Daniel out of the lion's den and there was not even a scratch on Daniel. The men who wrongly accused Daniel were thrown into the lion's den and the king sent a message to everyone.
