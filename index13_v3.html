		<center><h2>Women at the Well</h2></center>
	<center><h2>(John 4:1-30)</h2></center>
			<p>Jesus was on his way to Galilee with his disciples, and on the way, they stopped in a Samaritan village. The disciples went to get food, and Jesus was at a well, as he was tired from his walk. Soon, a Samaritan woman came to the well to get water. Jesus asked for some water. Jews at the time refused to do anything with the Samaritans, and she was surprised. The woman asks why he is asking for water. Jesus replies, Anyone who drinks water from me will not be thirsty, but whoever drinks water from the well will be thirsty. Jesus says that if she knows, she should ask him for water. The woman asks for the water. Jesus tells her to get her husband. But the woman does not have a husband, as the woman married 5 husbands but has none now, they continue their conversation, then the woman speaks about the coming messiah and will explain everything to them. Jesus says he is the messiah. The disciples came back, and the Samaritan woman went and told her whole village about Jesus. The disciples were very confused, and the whole village came and asked them to stay at the village, and Jesus did and continued teaching about God.
